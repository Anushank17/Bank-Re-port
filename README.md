Bank Loan Report Analysis

1. Project Overview:

This project focuses on analyzing a large dataset of bank loan applications, consisting of over 30,000 entries. The goal was to derive meaningful insights and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to understand the trends and performance of the bank's loan processing. The analysis was conducted using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for querying and data manipulation, and Power BI was used for creating interactive dashboards.

2.Steps Involved:

  a. Data Import
    - The dataset was imported from Excel into Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
    - The Excel file contained over 30,000 loan application records, including details on loan amounts, statuses, and other relevant information.

 b. Data Analysis with SQL
   - Using SQL, various queries were executed to calculate key metrics such as:
   - Total loan applications
   - Total amount received
   - Funded amount by the bank
   - Approval and rejection rates
   - Other relevant KPIs
   - The queries provided the foundation for further analysis and visualization.

 c. Data Visualization with Power BI
   - The SQL data was imported into Power BI to create dynamic and interactive dashboards.
   - Three main dashboards were designed:
   - Summary Dashboard: Provides a high-level view of key metrics and trends.
   - Overview Dashboard: Delves deeper into the loan approval process, showcasing details such as approval rates, loan amounts, and demographic insights.
   - Details Dashboard: Offers a granular look at individual loan records and more specific metrics.

3. Key Features:

- Data Source: Excel file with 30,000+ loan records, imported into SQL Server.
- SQL Queries: Used for calculating KPIs and extracting insights from the data.
- Power BI Dashboards: Created for real-time visualization of the results, with interactive elements for a detailed exploration of the data.

4. Conclusion:

This project successfully analyzes a large dataset of bank loan applications, providing insights and visualizations that can assist in decision-making and performance tracking. The combination of SQL and Power BI enables both data manipulation and dynamic reporting, making it easier to interpret complex data and extract actionable insights.
